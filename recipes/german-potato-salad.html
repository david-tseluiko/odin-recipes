    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is my mother's recipe for authentic German potato salad. Everyone,
      German or not, loves it. It is easy to double the recipe as well. I often
      bring it to potlucks, and we also have it at home on special occasions.
      There are usually no leftovers, but if there are, they don't last long!
